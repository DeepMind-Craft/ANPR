The file models/yolov8n_custom.pt is a binary file that contains the trained YOLO model weights. As such, it cannot be represented as text content. You would typically generate this file by training your model using the training script you provided earlier (train.py). 

After training, the model weights will be saved in the specified path (models/yolov8n_custom.pt). Therefore, this file is intentionally left blank as it will be created during the training process.
